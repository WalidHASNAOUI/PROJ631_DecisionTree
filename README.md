Decision Tree Algorithms: From ID3 to C4.5
Overview

This project implements two popular decision tree algorithms: ID3 and C4.5. Decision trees are powerful machine learning models that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. This repository provides Python implementations of these algorithms, along with examples and utility functions to facilitate understanding and usage.
Features

    ID3 Algorithm: A basic decision tree algorithm that uses information gain for feature selection.
    C4.5 Algorithm: An improved version of ID3 that handles both categorical and continuous attributes and uses gain ratio for feature selection.
